title: "Causal Estimators"
---

This page offers a tutorial on causal estimators. We first designed this page for the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science at UCLA in June 2024.

See the first page for intuition about causal estimators. The next page provides code to simulate data. You can choose any of the subsequent pages in any order to practice applying causal estimators.
